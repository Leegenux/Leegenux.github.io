Tailscale is a useful utility to connect all your devices together with a virtual LAN. It's based on Wireguard and supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS operating system.

Derpers are relay nodes in the tailscale network. Since all the tailscale Derpers are deployed outside of China, a private derper is necessary for fast connection. For offcial documentation, please refer to [Custom DERP Servers - Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/kb/1118/custom-derp-servers/)
